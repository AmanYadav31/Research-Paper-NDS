This is a research paper that I co-authored titled "Role of Sum of Objectives in Non-Dominated Sorting to Reduce Dominance Comparisons," focusing on minimizing comparisons during insertion in Efficient Non-dominated Sorting(ENS). The proposed method improved the running time of the algorithm by 30\%, significantly enhancing overall complexity. The paper is currently submitted for IEEE Tencon 2024.
